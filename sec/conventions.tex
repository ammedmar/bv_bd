\subsection*{Conventions}

We work over a field  $\k$ of characteristic $0$ and over the underlying category of differential graded modules.
We use the homological degree convention, for which differentials have degree $-1$.
(Cohomology in degree $-n$)
We denote the symmetric groups by $\Sy_n$.
We use the conventions of operad introduced in \cite{LodayVallette12}.
Since we will always work in over differential graded vector spaces, we will often drop ``differential graded" or ``dg''.
\Bruno{$\odot$ definition : symmetric tensor product, i.e. $\odot \coloneq \otimes /\Sy_2$}
