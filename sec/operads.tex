\section{The operad \(\cBV_{\!\infty}\)}\label{sec:operads}

\subsection{Conventions}

In the previous section we worked with cochain complexes over a field \(\KK\) of characteristic \(0\) (\cref{ss:dgVec}).
Here we work in the category of chain complexes over \(\KK\), where differentials have degree \(-1\).
A cochain complex \((C^\bullet, d)\) can be regarded as a chain complex via \(C_n = C^{-n}\).

We follow the operadic conventions of \cite{LodayVallette12} and
%\(\Sy\)-modules (\S5.1),
%algebras over operads (\S5.2),
%the free operad construction \(\cT\) (\S5.5),
%the free cooperad construction \(\cT^\c\) (\S5.8.6),
%differential graded operads (\S6.3),
%quadratic operads \(\cP(E,R)\) and cooperads \(\cC(E,R)\) (\S7.1).
work in Hinich’s model category of differential non-negatively graded operads \cite{Hinich97}, which we refer to simply as operads.
In this model structure, fibrations are surjective morphisms of operads and weak equivalences are aritywise quasi-isomorphisms.
