%\anibal{Learn more about Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem as a way of describing BV in polyvector fields.}
%\anibal{About super-geometry and the BV formalism: forms as functions on shifted tangent bundle.}
%\anibal{Regarding the BD statement of Bruno, look at connection with the operadic result of Costello in his renormalization book section 2.8. Operadic interpretation of the quantum master equation. The main theorem relates quantizations with BD extensions. What in the book with Gwilliams is taken as definition, I think.}
%
%\anibal{There are two other papers at least to cite: the quartic theory, where the bvinfty structure was defined first, it seems.
	%	The other is earlier, by the same people, the gauge structure of double field theory follows from YM. There, this formulation of YM was deduced from some stringy thing, where it seems that there is an additional ``field'' that, when integrated out gives the ``usual'' YM theory. Important to say that this version of YM gives using the MC action the correponding YM action (2.21 in the earlier paper : the gauge structure ...) }
%
%\anibal{A cool thing to include is display equation 4.56 in the quartic theory, where they show how to get the Color-Kinematic numerators satisfying jacobi from the homotopy poisson relation.}
%
%\anibal{In the double copy via tensor product, they say that the Reitener bvbox extends Zeitlin's and references the usual paper. In that paper, the complex that looks more like it (first order), is credited to Costello. It seems to be 5.2 RENORMALISATION AND THE BATALIN-VILKOVISKY FORMALISM --- It is also in the book, page 209, read that one.}
